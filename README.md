# Bangrad radical music discovery

Bangrad is a place for music connoisseurs, hobby musicians and anyone looking to search
the Spotify database for a particular track based on its tempo, musical key, location, language,
popularity, release year and more. The large spotify database, sometimes called the jukebox
of the universe, had in fact in 2023 around 80 million tracks to choose from.



## Features

### search queries

The user can make searches in the database based on only one or several parameters combined.
Which gives the user a powerful tool for doing very specialized searches. The search will
return a list for the user with the search queries and display the artists, songs that are
matching and links to the respective spotify tracks.

### List gallery

After each search the user can choose to save the list in their profile gallery. The user can arrange
the saved list in folders of their choice. The user can for instance create a folder called
dancefloor bangers and inside this folder create more folders with names of their choice.

### The Lodge

The lodge is where users can meet and exchange artists they've discovered and share their lists.
